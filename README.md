# 330_final_project

These files comprise my final project for Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming. The project was meant to use our newly develped front end and back end development skills to learn at least one new framework or language that we did not cover in class (I learned flask and SQlite). 

I created a website that allowed users to login and see the current stats of their favorite team. Users could also search by statistic and see which team lead (or is leading) that statistic for the year they entered.
